               My name is Joshua Thompson and I'm a sophomore at Kennesaw State University. I'm majoring in Information Technology and I'm minoring in Business.
                I enjoy Information Technology because I love creating new products that will keep society growing as a whole. I have learned how to code in Java, Python, and now I'm learning how to write in SQL and HTML. I'm currently learning how to fix problems consumers may have with their computers such as troubleshooting. Information Technology is a fun major because people don't have to code all day. People can be creative and make products hands-on as well. Compared to any other majors, Information Technology is very versatile. I believe if it wasn't for technology, life wouldn't have evolved as fast as it did.

            <!-- Additional paragraphs about hobbies and personal philosophy -->
            <p class="additional-text">
              Some of the hobbies that I do are that I skateboard, model, and create content. I would make this my main hustle, but I don't have much progression with it so it'll take some time. I always try and do tasks I've done before to add flavor into my life. I feel like people get comfortable with doing the same habits daily after they finish working. I enjoy hanging with family and friends. Relationships are special to me because each one is unique and teaches you a lesson. Some people say the reasoning why they don't have friends is because the world is cruel and it's true. I agree to disagree because even though there's negativity, there's positivity. People should understand the people who are negative so they can keep them out of their life. When they're able to keep negative people out of their life, they can make friends with people who are positive. I don't think people should live their lives without making friends because they may end up miserable. This life is not about only one person, but everyone else.
            </p>

            <p class="additional-text">
               I enjoy reading books as well. Specifically, I read self-growth and philosophy books beacuse they teach me how to be a better individual for myself, my friends, and the world. I would refer the books called, "Beyond Order", by Jordan Peterson. I feel that people have underestimated the impact books can have on their minds. It's very important to learn new things every day and books are the antidote for that. If people don't like books, you can sign up for online or in-person courses that teach you skills that could help you. Reading books has always been looked down upon because people don't want to come off as weird, but being weird makes you stand out. What's weird to someone else could be cool to another person and that's fine.
